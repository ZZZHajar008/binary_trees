**0x1D. C - Binary trees**

0. New node: 

* C function that creates a binary tree node with a given parent and value.
* Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.

1. Insert left:

* C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.
* Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
* If the given parent already contains a left node, the new node takes its place and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

2. Insert right:

* C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another.
* Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
* If the given parent already contains a right node, the new node takes its place and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

3. Delete:

* C function that deletes an entire binary tree.

4. Is leaf:

* C function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
* Returns 1 if the node is a leaf, 0 otherwise.

5. Is root:

* C function that checks if a given node is a root.
* Returns 1 if the node is a root, 0 otherwise.

6. Pre-order traversal:

* C function that traverse a tree using pre-order traversal.

7. In-order traversal:

* C function that traverses a tree using in-order traversal.

8. Post-order traversal:

* C function that traverses a tree using post-order traversal.

9. Height:

* C function that returns the height of a binary tree.

10. Depth: 

* C function that returns the depth of a given node in a binary tree.

11. Size:

* C function that returns the size of a binary tree.

12. Leaves:

* C function that returns the number of leaves in a binary tree.

13. Nodes:

* C function that returns the number of nodes in a binary tree with at least one child.

14. Blance factor:

* C function that returns the balance factor of a binary tree.

15. Is full:

* C function that checks if a binary tree is full.
* Returns 1 if a tree is full, 0 otherwise.

16. Is perfect:

* C function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
* Returns 1 if a tree is perfect, 0 otherwise.

17. Sibling:

* C function that returns a pointer to the sibling of a given node in a binary tree.
* Returns NULL if no sibling is found.

18. Uncle:

* C function that returns a pointer to the uncle of a given node in a binary tree.
* Returns NULL if no uncle is found.
